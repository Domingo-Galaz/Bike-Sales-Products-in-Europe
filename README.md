# Bike-Sales-Products-in-Europe
🔍 Project Overview
In this project, I explore a dataset containing bike sales products data across various European and Non-European countries and their regions/states. The dataset consists of 18 columns, with the main focus on the Sales column, which represents the revenue generated by bike purchases.

The goal of this analysis is to extract valuable and meaningful insights from the dataset using data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. These insights can help identify sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance.

🧠 Objectives
Analyze total sales across each country and state within Europe.

Understand sales trends based on gender (Male vs Female customers).

Explore the number of bikes sold per product and their total sales.

Identify the most popular products and the highest revenue generators.

Visualize relationships and trends using graphs for easier interpretation.
